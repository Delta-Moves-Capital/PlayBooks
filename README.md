## âž• Adding New Playbooks

To add a new strategy playbook:

1. **Create a new folder** under the root directory with a descriptive name:
   ```powershell
   mkdir NewStrategy_Playbook
````

2. **Inside that folder**, include at minimum:

   * A main markdown file (e.g., `NewStrategy_Playbook.md`)
   * Any supporting files like `.csv`, `.ipynb`, `.png`, etc.

3. **Update this README**:

   * Add a new bullet under `Current Playbooks` linking to the new strategyâ€™s markdown file.

4. **Commit and push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added NewStrategy_Playbook"
   git push
   ```
